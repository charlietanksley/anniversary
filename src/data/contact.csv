Congratulations on your 50th wedding Anniversary. That is a tremendous milestone. Occasions like this cause us to look back. 50 years is enough time to create lot of memories, some good, some not. There are memories that this anniversary will trigger, some in you, some in others. Memories will be triggered in others that you're probably not aware of. In couples young and old, that you have impacted in countless ways in all of the places you have served and lived. You both have modeled a marriage grounded in love, assured by commitment and centered on God and family. 

Your marriage blessed our family 18 years ago when your daughter joined our family and became our daughter too. Prayers and best wishes for many more happy years together.

You two have had such a fabulous adventure together, and I can't wait to see all the awesome things you do together in the coming years. LOVE LOVE LOVE you both! Did I already say that? Well, I love you. And congratulations again.
