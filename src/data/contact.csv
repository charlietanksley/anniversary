"Joy Tanksley","Mom and Dad, I love you both so much and am so happy to wish you a happy 50th wedding anniversary. What a beautiful milestone! I love the love you share, and I'm so grateful for both of you. It was so much fun looking through all these awesome pictures - some I had seen before and some I hadn't. You two have had such a fabulous adventure together, and I can't wait to see all the awesome things you do together in the coming years. LOVE LOVE LOVE you both! Did I already say that? Well, I love you. And congratulations again. \r\n\r\nYour daughter,\r\n\r\n"
